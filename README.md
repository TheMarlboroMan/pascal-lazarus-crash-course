#A crash course in Object Pascal and the Lazarus IDE.

#Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge about coding is required (what are control flow structures,
	what are functions, what is a class, what is an operator, what are
	escape sequences...).

- Basic knowledge about data types is required (what is a string, what is a 
	number, what is an array, what is a map, what is an instance...).

- Basic knowledge about filesystems and streams is required (what is a file,
	what is the standard input/output...).

##Tools you will need:

- Free Pascal Compiler (2.6.2-8).
- Lazarus IDE (1.0.10).
- A text editor.

##Why Pascal?

###But this is not really Pascal.

###But I read somewhere that Pascal is dead.

##How to use this?

Write along as you read, try and compile often, play with the examples.

##Compiling the examples

fpc ./001_basics.pas -FEexec/

/usr/bin/ld.bfd: warning: exec/link.res contains output sections; did you forget -T?
